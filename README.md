# Tone-identifier
A mini project.  The Task: In the simplest and most efficient way possible, create a program that takes in a string of words, or that can read a file, then using either a given list of words (for each tone) or a machine learning algorithm, it will dictate the tone of the given passage.

The program will utilize the MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATEÂ® THESAURUS API, and will cross reference other words in order to identify if a word is either "positive" or "negative". Probably between 5 or 6 passes. (In terms of the synonyms cross-reference)

Possible application of machine learning as well.
