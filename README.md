# Tone_identifier
A mini project.  Task: In the simplest and most efficient way possible, create a program that takes in a string of words, or that can read a file, then using either a given list of words (for each tone), or a machine learning algorithm, dictate the tone of the given passage.

The program will utilize the MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATEÂ® THESAURUS API, and will cross reference other words in order to identify if a word is either "positive" or "negative".
