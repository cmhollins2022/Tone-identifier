# Purpose
This Mock-up will give a brief break-down of the core facets included in the "tone-identifier" Minin project.

## Functionality and Design Structure:
The program at its core should be able to...
1. Take in a piece of text from multiple source types.
2. Break up the words within the text, converting them into strings.
3. Preform an analysis of each word (or string) based upon information from the MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATEÂ® THESAURUS API. This step will include dictating whether the string has more positive synonyms or negative synonyms, afterwhich evaluating (based on the given data) if the word is *"positive"*, *"negative"*, or *"neutral"*.
