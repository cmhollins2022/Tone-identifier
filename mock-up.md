# Purpose
A Mock-up to give a brief break-down of the core facets included in the "tone-identifier" mini project.

## Functionality and Design Structure:
The program at its core should be able to...
1. Take in a piece of text from multiple source types.
2. Break up the words within the text, converting them into strings.
3. Preform an analysis of each word (or string) based upon information from the MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATEÂ® THESAURUS API. This step will include dictating whether the string has more positive synonyms or negative synonyms, afterwhich evaluating (based on the given data) if the word is *"positive"*, *"negative"* or *"neutral"*.
4. After categorizing each word into one of the three options, the program will visually represent the statistics of the piece of text based on its given data.
5. Using a machine learning algorithm, the program should be able to dictate whether or not a word is *"positive"*, *"negative"* or *"neutral"* with only its relative synonyms.
